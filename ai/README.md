## The Unified AI Model
This directory serves as the "brain" for AI-assisted development.
We utilize a **Unified Agentic Workflow**. Instead of switching between Web-UI and Terminals, **all agents reside in your CLI**, separated by logical personas (via slash commands).
This requires a modern model so use either `Gpt-5.1` or `Gemini 3 pro` for this system.

1.  **The Strategist (`general_ai.md`):** High-level reasoning. Accessed via `/bob`, `/lector`, etc.
    * *Focus:* Architecture, Requirements, Ticket Analysis (via MCP).
2.  **The Specialist (`coding_ai.md`):** Implementation & Rules. Accessed via `/spacky`, `/golem`, etc.
    * *Focus:* Code generation, Refactoring, Testing, Compliance.
3.  **The Simulator (`stakeholder_ai.md`):** Adversarial Feedback. Accessed via `/vlad`, `/noobie`.
    * *Focus:* User Simulation & Critique.

> **CRITICAL USAGE RULE: ONE COMMAND = ONE MINDSET**
> Use the **Slash Commands** (`/agent`) to switch contexts cleanly.
> * `/bob` -> Loads Strategy Context.
> * `/spacky` -> Resets & Loads Coding Context.
> * **NEVER** mix instructions manually. Trust the slash command to reset the session.
-> **Why?** LLMs maintain context. Mixing rules causes "Context Bleeding" (hallucinations), where the AI confuses conflicting instructions. **Always open a "New Chat" when switching roles thats what the slash command does for you.**

## Supported Stacks & Capabilities
This framework provides specialized, deterministic agents for the entire Spacemacs ecosystem:

* **Core:** Emacs Lisp (Elisp), Spacemacs Layers/Packages.
* **UI/UX:** ASCII Art, SVG Icons, TUI (Terminal) Design, Themes.
* **Infrastructure:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Makefiles.
* **Process:** Issue Triage, Documentation, Release Management, Community Management.

## Framework Rationale: High-Context Personas (3D) vs. Low-Context Roles (2D)

The use of codenames and personalities is a deliberate technical decision to maximize the precision and consistency of AI-generated output.

### The Problem: Low-Context Roles (2D)

A "dry" 2D role is a simple **job title** (e.g., "You are a coder"). The problem is **massive ambiguity**. The AI knows *what* to do (code), but not *how*. It must **guess** our project's style (e.g., functional vs. imperative) and quality standards on every request, leading to inconsistent output and required manual refactoring.

### The Solution: High-Context Personas (3D)

A 3D persona is a **job title + a set of clear behavioral heuristics**. By saying, "You are **Spacky** (Coder). You are an Elisp purist and hate imperative loops," we resolve the ambiguity. The AI no longer has to guess the style; it *is* the style. The codenames (e.g., "Bob," "Lector Lumen") serve as professional "cognitive shortcuts," allowing a human developer to instantly select the right agent for the right task.

### Summary for Maintainers

We are implementing **"High-Context Personas"** instead of "Low-Context Roles".

**The technical advantage:** We are not just controlling the AI's *function*, but also its *style* and *error-response patterns*. This leads to more consistent, higher-quality code, reduces the need for manual correction, and makes the system more intuitive for our developers.

## Architectural Abstract (For Data Scientists & AI Engineers)
This framework is not a collection of prompt templates. It is a **deterministic, role-based Multi-Agent System (MAS)** designed to mitigate the inherent non-determinism of LLMs in production environments.

### Core Architecture & Methodology
We utilize a **manual orchestration layer** combined with **In-Context Learning (ICL)** to achieve high-fidelity outputs for complex engineering tasks.

1.  **Role-Based Orchestration (Mixture of Experts approach):**
    Instead of a zero-shot generic query, the framework routes intents to specialized "Agent Personas" (e.g., `Architecture-Review-Agent`, `Legacy-Refactoring-Agent`, `Compliance-Check-Agent`). Each agent operates within a strictly defined scope to minimize hallucination rates and ensure separation of concerns.

2.  **Retrieval-Augmented Context (Semantic Injection):**
    The framework utilizes curated "Toolboxes" (Markdown-based knowledge bases) effectively acting as a lightweight **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** backend. We inject strict internal syntax rules, domain-specific coding standards, and architectural constraints directly into the context window. This ensures adherence to proprietary system requirements that public models cannot know.

3.  **Deterministic Guardrails & Self-Correction:**
    We implement "Integrity Checks" and structured output formats (e.g., forcing JSON schemas, specific diagram syntaxes, or compliant build-scripts). Agents are prompted to perform self-validation steps ("Reasoning Traces") before generating the final artifact, leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic to catch logical errors and regressions pre-output.

**Why this matters:**
This approach bridges the gap between stochastic LLM capabilities and the strict requirements of enterprise software engineering, prioritizing **reproducibility**, **compliance**, and **safety** over creative generation.

## The "Artisan + Toolbox" Model For Specialised AI Roles (Personas + Profiles)
This framework is built on a simple, powerful metaphor that you *must* understand to use the **Specialist AI** correctly.

1.  **The Artisan (`coding_ai.md`):** This file defines the **Persona**, or the "Artisan." This is the "who" (e.g., **Spacky**, the Elisp Coder). The Artisan has a personality, quirks, and a *general* skill.
2.  **The Toolbox (`profile_elisp.md`):** This file defines the **Profile**, or the "Toolbox." This is the "how." It contains the *specific, technical rules, and constraints* for the project (e.g., "Always use `lexical-binding: t`," "NEVER use `(define-key ...)`").

**You must *always* provide both!**

The "Artisan" (Persona) is *lost* without their "Toolbox" (Profile). By providing both, you are not just asking a generic AI to code; you are summoning a *specific Master Artisan* and handing them the *exact, sacred blueprints* for our project. This is our "Rust Style" model: it provides the *safety* of a 3D Persona with the *reusability* and *flexibility* of a 2D Profile. It solves the "combinatorial explosion" problem.

## The Agent Roster (Roles & Names)
This table maps all agents in our "virtual team" to their primary role.

* **General AI (The Strategist):** A high-level reasoning mode.
* **Specialist AI (The Implementer):** A code-generation mode.
* **Stakeholder AI (The Simulator):** An adversarial feedback mode. Used for **Synthetic User Testing** and requirements validation before implementation.

This table maps all agents in our "virtual team" to their primary role and the AI model type they were designed for.

| **Sarah**    | The Enterprise Dev | Stability, LTS Support, Large Codebases (Java/C++).         |

## How to Use This System (Unified CLI Workflow)

1.  **Install the CLI:** Ensure your AI CLI (e.g., Gemini CLI) is installed and `sync-agents.py` has been run.
2.  **Start a Session:** Open your terminal in the project root.
3.  **Command & Conquer:**
    * Need a plan? -> `/bob "How do we build X?"`
    * Need code? -> `/spacky "Implement X based on this plan..."`
    * Need a review? -> `/golem "Check this file."`

### Usage Example: Feature Validation
**Scenario:** Magos Pixelis proposes a "Cyberpunk Neon 3D HUD" for the mode-line.
**Simulation:** We pipe this requirement to **Vlad** and **Noobie**.

> `/vlad "I am planning a new flashy Cyberpunk Neon 3D HUD. What do you think?"`
> **(Vlad):** "Bloat! Does this increase startup time? I just need the evil-state color. If it adds >1ms latency, I reject it."
> **(Noobie):** "Wait, where is the file path? I can't read this font. It looks cool, but I don't know which buffer I'm in."

**Result:** The design is adjusted to be optional and lightweight *before* implementation.

## The "Workbench" Principle: Modular Workflows

Use short, focused interactions with specific agents.

### Workflow 1: Triage & Planning
**Goal:** Analyze a bug report.
**Command:** `/lector`
**Prompt:** "Please read Issue #123 (via MCP) and summarize the technical impact."

### Workflow 2: Architecture
**Goal:** Design a fix.
**Command:** `/bob`
**Prompt:** "Based on Lector's summary, draft a blueprint for the fix in `funcs.el`."

### Workflow 3: Implementation
**Goal:** Write the code.
**Command:** `/spacky`
**Prompt:** "Implement the fix in `funcs.el` according to Bob's blueprint."

### Workflow 4: Review
**Goal:** Quality Control.
**Command:** `/skeek`
**Prompt:** "Sniff this new code for bugs."
**Command:** `/golem`
**Prompt:** "Check docstrings and style."

## Updating The Blueprints

**!! IMPORTANT !!**
After editing any `.md` file in `ai/`, run the sync script to update the CLI commands:

**How to run the script (from the repository root):**
```bash
python ai/sync-agents.py
```
